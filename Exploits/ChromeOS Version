Here's how to see your ChromeOS version:

Method 1:
- Go to chrome://version.
- It should have a number like v1xx on version for one of the lines - this is your chromeOS version. Ignore anything after the decimal, it probably doesn't matter for you.

Method 2:
- Go to settings, scroll down to the “about chromeos” or update page, and it should say the version.

Method 3:
- Go to the lockscreen (ctrl+shift+q+q, sign out, restart the chromebook) and press ALT+V.
- It should show the version in the top right, “Google Chrome X”.
